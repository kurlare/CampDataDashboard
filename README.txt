To run the app, create a new directory and place the files there.
Open RStudio and set your working directory to "C:/.../campdashboard app".  
Open the server.R file in RStudio, and run the line 9 'source()' function.  
You may have to install the packages 'DT', 'Shiny', 'ggplot2', 'mice', and 'dplyr'.
Use 'install.packages("package_name") to install the packages.

Finally, click on the drop down menu for the 'Run App' button.  Select 'Run External',
and the App should load.  Have fun!
